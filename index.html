                Greetings, dear friends! My name is
                Ehab, and for the past 18 years, I have
                been working as a tour guide fluent in
                both English and French. I was born and
                raised in Luxor, a city located in Upper
                Egypt that boasts incredible monuments
                and artifacts from the Pharaonic
                civilization, such as the temples of Karnak
                and Luxor and the tombs of legendary
                pharaohs. It brings me great joy to
                connect the present with the past, and to
                showcase the magnificence and
                splendor of Egypt to visitors from all
                corners of the world. Whether it's
                exploring Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor, or
                Aswan, or soaking up the sun on the
                stunning beaches of the Red Sea in
                Hurghada, Sharm El-Sheikh, or Marsa
                Alam, there is something truly special
                about experiencing Egypt's wonders
                firsthand.

                        and ancient monuments in
                        the world, which is the Karnak Temple or Karnak Temples. It is considered a collection of
                        temples in the Pharaonic
                        civilization of Egypt. It is the main seat of the worship of the god Amun Ra, the very important
                        sun god in the city of
                        Thebes (the ancient name of Luxor now). In this ancient city, we will see how the ancient
                        Egyptian built his
                        civilization that made him immortal over time. This visit will not be complete except by
                        visiting the Luxor Temple, 3
                        kilometers south of the Karnak temples. There we will see the celebration hall and how the
                        ancient Egyptian lived in a
                        state of joy and celebration of the arrival of this great god. We will feel the value of this

                    <p>In the west of Luxor, there we will visit the eternal homes of the kings of Egypt, which are
                        known as the tombs of the
                        great pharaohs. In fact, they are not tombs as much as they are underground royal palaces, as
                        there are 62 tombs for the
                        rulers of ancient Egypt, such as Ramesses II, Thutmose III, Tutankhamun, and others. There we
                        will see the true
                        greatness of this civilization and what it is. For them, the subject of death is merely a
                        journey that will take them to
                        a better world, After that, we will visit the temple of Queen Hatshepsut, who ruled Egypt for 27
                        years in 1400 BC. This
                        lady was worthy of ruling Egypt, as she showed a lot of greatness and glory throughout that
                        period in the life of Egypt.
                        This temple is built on 3 floors and is considered different from the rest of the temples in the
                        Temple of That queen,
                        we will see bright colors that are pleasing to the eye, and we will learn about how the ancient
                        Egyptian used colors.
                        The third visit on this day is to visit the two statues of Memnon, which are located on the side
                        of the road. Each
                        statue weighs 700 tons. There we will see the history of this place, as behind the two statues
                        there was a very huge
                        temple for King Amenhotep III

                    <p>On the way from Luxor to Aswan in southern Egypt, you can discover two very beautiful temples in
                        the south of Luxor. You
                        are going to the city of Aswan, which is considered the last governorate in southern Egypt.
                        These two temples are the
                        Temple of Edfu, which is located 120 kilometers south of Luxor and is dedicated to the worship
                        of the god Horus, “the
                        falcon.” There You will know what is the history of this good god who was able to conquer evil
                        represented by his uncle,
                        the evil god Set. This is considered one of the best preserved temples in Egypt. As for the
                        other temple, it is Kom
                        Ombo, which is located 45 kilometers before the city of Aswan, and it is dedicated to the
                        worship of the god Sobek, “the
                        crocodile.” There we will see a museum for preserving crocodile mummies, since this area was the
                        headquarters for
                        worshiping the crocodile, and we will see what was the idea that made the ancient Egyptians
                        worship these animals and
                        make them Gods worthy of respect</p>

                        Nile. The second visit to a project considered one of the largest projects built in Egypt in the
